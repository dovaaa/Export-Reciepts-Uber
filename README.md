"# Export-Reciepts-Uber" 

Using Selenium Python
I'm currently developing this project in order to learn selenium by automating day to day life

currently this project is estimated to save me at least an hour each month, but will also save me a headache of uploading my transportation reciepts to the company portal

I'll be automating the process from start to end hopefully

#phase 1:
  download the reciepts and get the totals

#phase 2:
  export the totals, and description to a csv in order to upload it
#phase 3:
  upload to company portal... this script could be private as we don't want the ccredentials to be public on github

  If you have any comments or have an idea, raise an issue and send to me over any of my contact info, cheers
